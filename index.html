        The Avengers is a popular team of superheroes appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
        Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the team first appeared in The Avengers in September 
        1963. The original Avengers lineup included Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and the Wasp. The team 
        was famously branded as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes."

                Loki gains control of the Tesseract, a powerful energy source, and threatens
                 Earth. To counter this, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes: Iron Man,
                  Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, known as the Avengers.
                   Despite initial conflicts and differences, they come together to face the common
                    threat. They engage in a massive battle in New York City against Loki and his 
                    alien army. The Avengers manage to close the portal bringing the aliens, defeat
                     Loki, and save humanity from enslavement. This monumental victory not only 
                     secures their place as Earth's mightiest heroes but also paves the way for
                      their future missions and the formation of a strong, united team.

                Tony Stark and Bruce Banner attempt to revive an AI program called Ultron to protect
                 Earth, but Ultron becomes sentient and aims to eradicate humanity. He recruits twins
                  Pietro and Wanda Maximoff to help him drop a massive chunk of Sokovia onto Earth, 
                  causing global extinction. The Avengers realize the threat and work together to 
                  stop Ultron. Pietro and Wanda switch sides to join the Avengers. In a climactic 
                  battle, the Avengers destroy Ultron's army and create Vision, a powerful ally, 
                  who helps defeat Ultron and save the world.

                Thanos embarks on a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones to achieve his goal of wiping 
                out half of the universe's life to restore balance. He obtains several stones through
                 intense battles, including encounters with the Avengers on multiple fronts. Despite 
                 the Avengers' desperate efforts to thwart him, Thanos succeeds in acquiring the 
                 remaining stones, including the Mind Stone from Vision. With all six stones in
                  his possession, Thanos snaps his fingers, triggering the disintegration of half 
                  of all life in the universe, including many Avengers. Following his devastating
                   victory, Thanos retreats to a remote location and watches the sunrise, content with
                    the success of his plan.

         After Thanos uses the Infinity Stones to erase half of all life, the Avengers 
         regroup to confront him but find he has destroyed the Stones. Five years later,
          Ant-Man proposes a plan to use time travel to retrieve the Stones from the past.
           The Avengers succeed in collecting them and Hulk reverses the snap, restoring 
           those who were lost. This leads to a battle with a past version of Thanos. 
           Iron Man sacrifices himself using the Stones to defeat Thanos. Captain America
            returns the Stones and stays in the past with Peggy Carter, passing his shield
             to Falcon, marking a poignant end to their era as Earth's protectors.
